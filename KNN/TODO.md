## TODO 
# For KNN
- [x] Create manhattan distance
- [x] Create euclidean distance 
- [x] Create max distance
- [x] Create minkowski distance to call any of the above mentioned functions
- [x] Create function that predicts the distance between a test point and a class point already defined
- [x] Create a fucntion that gets the k nearest of objects (neighbors) near the test point
- [x] Create a function that identifies the class of a point and shows the most frequent class available 
- [ ] Create PCA that reduce vector dimenionality in order to visualize better
- [ ] (optional) randomly drop features so that there are two left so that KNN can be visualized as a 2 dimensional graph
- [ ] visualize training points and the test instance 
- [ ] visualize grouping of kNN
